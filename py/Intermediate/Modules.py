# Modules in Python
# -----------------
# A module is a file containing Python code (functions, classes, variables) that you can import into your programs.

# Importing a module:
import math
print(math.sqrt(9))

# Importing specific items:
from math import pi
print(pi)

# You can create your own modules by writing Python code in a .py file and importing it.

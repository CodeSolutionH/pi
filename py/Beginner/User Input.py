# User Input in Python
# --------------------
# You can get input from the user using the input() function.

# Example:
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")

# The input() function always returns a string.
# To get a number, you need to convert the input:
age = int(input("How old are you? "))
print(f"You are {age} years old.")

# Operators in Python
# -------------------
# Operators are special symbols used to perform operations on variables and values.

# Arithmetic Operators:
a = 10
b = 3
print(a + b)  # Addition: 13
print(a - b)  # Subtraction: 7
print(a * b)  # Multiplication: 30
print(a / b)  # Division: 3.333...
print(a % b)  # Modulus: 1
print(a ** b) # Exponentiation: 1000
print(a // b) # Floor division: 3

# Comparison Operators:
print(a == b)  # Equal: False
print(a != b)  # Not equal: True
print(a > b)   # Greater than: True
print(a < b)   # Less than: False
print(a >= b)  # Greater or equal: True
print(a <= b)  # Less or equal: False

# Logical Operators:
x = True
y = False
print(x and y)  # Logical AND: False
print(x or y)   # Logical OR: True
print(not x)    # Logical NOT: False

# Assignment Operators:
c = 5
c += 2  # c = c + 2
print(c)  # Output: 7
